# LeOS
This is a simple kernel I'm writing while following several tutorials for teaching myself low-level concepts.

## Build
First of all, build a gcc riscv64-unknown toolchain. I'm not going to explain that here, there are enough resources on the internet. 

Then, to run it through qemu, just run 
```
make qemu
```

# Stuff
## Paging 
TODO: write this.
Paging is something that took me quite some time to figure out.
